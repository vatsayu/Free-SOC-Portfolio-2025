# Day 2 – December 20, 2025

### Completed Tasks
- **Splunk Training**:
  - Registered on ISTEP platform and started "Intro to Splunk" eLearning course.
  - Course in progress – videos and quiz launched.
- **LetsDefend Alerts Triaged**:
  - SOC127 – SQL Injection Detected (High severity, True Positive)
  - Explored Endpoint Security tab for deeper host investigation.
- **Points Earned**: 7+ (dashboard orange circle)
- **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)**:
  - Started pre-assessment quizzes (multiple modules unlocked and ready).
- **GitHub Updates**:
  - Added SQL Injection (SOC127) full writeup.
  - Continued structuring repo for future SPL/KQL/Sigma rules.

### Key Takeaways
- SQL injection remains a top web vulnerability – successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration (HTTP 200 + large payloads).
- Tools like sqlmap automate attacks, making detection of anomalous traffic critical.
- Endpoint Security tab in LetsDefend provides powerful host details (processes, containment options).
- Splunk intro started – excited to begin writing real SPL searches soon.
- ISC2 pre-assessment covers broad foundational concepts – excellent complement to hands-on triage.

### Time Spent
Approximately 5–6 hours (Splunk setup, alert triage, writeups, ISC2 pre-assessment)

### Next Steps (Day 3)
- Finish Splunk Intro modules + write 15 SPL searches
- Start KQL queries (Microsoft Sentinel)
- Triage 5 new alerts
- Complete first ISC2 Course 1 modules
- Add new writeups and screenshots to repo

Daily hands-on practice across multiple platforms is building real SOC muscle. Portfolio and skills growing stronger every day! 🚀
